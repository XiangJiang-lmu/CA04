# This is my CA04
# In 1. Data Source and Contents part, I read the data and transfered countinuous datas data to discrete categories data
# In 2. Finding Optimal Value of a key Ensemble Method Hyper parameter, I created DecisionTreeClassifier models for Accuracy and AUC VS n_estimators
# In 3. Building a Random Forest Model, I also created RandomForestClassifier models for Accuracy and AUC VS n_estimators, and changed the mubers in n_estimators.
# In 4. Building AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB. I created these 3 models for Accuracy and AUC VS n_estimators
# In 5. Compare Performance, I built a dataframe to collect the best values of Accuracy and AUC for four models like Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGB.
